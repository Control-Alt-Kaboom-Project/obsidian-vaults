# Agile Practices
**Agile**, in its simplest form can be described as:

![[Definitions of Agile.md#^d060f4]]







![[> [!Quote] Defininitions of Agile.md#^def1]] ^5a8437

!>  "A potentially quantitive property of which observes the ability to change."

Defined in this manner, in no way does it restrict or imply that which is being observed to be of any given material, object, or even a concept - a feeling, maybe even a [[state of mind.]]

In fact, it doesn't even limit the observable to be just one of the aforementioned definitions. The ability to transition, to simply alter a definable state in any respect imaginable.

When thought of this way, the word is extremely powerful. The ability to describe and observe the very nature of existence and reality itself. One could postulate that its another form of entropy, or just the transfer of information itself. Boggles the mind, definitely a topic for shortly after 4PM I think - the potential is endless.

What does it mean when an attempt to apply its usage on a skill or action is additionally defined by the object which possesses said skill or action. What if said object is not singular, but rather refers to a collective of individual objects ability to transition state

What does it mean when we measure a teams ability to execute action on a project, and its ability to pivot into another direction. Is it more agile for a team to be able to pivot more in respect to direction, or is it frequency. 

Why not both?
